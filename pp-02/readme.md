1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1090B0k-OuUg6J9p3ABEfmkOrdh
Your Rationale: This monochromatic color palette is centered around red, more adequately described as scarlet. My first impulse was to make the palette base closer to true red but orange has associations with energy and happiness which is a great atmosphere for a gaming console. The company advertising the console will want people to be excited about the product. However I find that red is really good for capturing attention, its bold, so the point of compromise would be scarlet which is a mixture of red and orange.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52D0B0ku9n4lGtpsasqzjjfIieA
Your Rationale: Green is associated with nature and new beginnings, making it a fitting color choice for springtime tours at the Botanical Gardens. Spring itself is a season often associated with new things and the Gardens themselves will be full of greenery. Since the palette is adjacent there's yellow and teal to go along with green. Yellow works well in this context, considering it has a lot of associations in the natural world. Generally, the colors presented in the announcement will tie in directly with the colors that visitors may experience during an actual tour.


3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3010U0kv8tujJA8o+v-w+njDFic
Your Rationale: I've learned that generally, kids like bright and bold colors. I've done art activities with children attending elementary school and found that all of them have a general understanding of what the primary colors are and can recognize these colors easily. Not to mention that they have a better understanding of how these colors mix when compared to the secondary colors. Therefore I thought that it would be a good choice to stick as close as possible to primary colors for this website since the app is targeted for kids, and to keep the colors intense. Red is the color with the largest emphasis in this palette, and I think it's a good choice considering how much it stands out in general use.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c3V164y3n0ks2n6hHHNqHEdJll7OwdC
Your Rationale: The focus of this palette is blue, it's a color I tend to see associated a lot with technology and I see it frequently in flyers and websites related to cybersecurity. Blue is associated with calmness and responsibility which is the kind of feel a cybersecurity course should give. The material the course will be providing is meant to give people the skills they need to confidently work in the security sector, therefore you'd want to give the impression of being trustworthy. Teal is also a popular color choice for cybersecurity marketing, likely due to how close it is to blue. The yellow-gold color is a strong accent choice, it's opposite of the three other colors on the wheel, guaranteeing it will stand out wherever it is used on the advertisement.
