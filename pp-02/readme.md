1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1090B0k-OuUg6J9p3ABEfmkOrdh
Your Rationale: This monochromatic color palette is centered around red, more adequately described as scarlet. My first impulse was to make the palette base closer to true red but orange has associations with energy and happiness which is a great atmosphere for a gaming console. The company advertising the console will want people to be excited about the product. However I find that red is really good for capturing attention, its bold, so the point of compromise would be scarlet which is a mixture of red and orange.
