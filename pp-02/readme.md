1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1090B0k-OuUg6J9p3ABEfmkOrdh
Your Rationale: This monochromatic color palette is centered around red, more adequately described as scarlet. My first impulse was to make the palette base closer to true red but orange has associations with energy and happiness which is a great atmosphere for a gaming console. The company advertising the console will want people to be excited about the product. However I find that red is really good for capturing attention, its bold, so the point of compromise would be scarlet which is a mixture of red and orange.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52D0B0ku9n4lGtpsasqzjjfIieA
Your Rationale: Green is associated with nature and new beginnings, making it a fitting color choice for springtime tours at the Botanical Gardens. Spring itself is a season often associated with new things and the Gardens themselves will be full of greenery. Since the palette is adjacent there's yellow and teal to go along with green. Yellow works well in this context, considering it has a lot of associations in the natural world. Generally, the colors presented in the announcement will tie in directly with the colors that visitors may experience during an actual tour.
