## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidelines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I implemented a few data entry guidelines in my sketch.
One of the points states that a site should only require fields for information that is truly necessary.
Based on what the MCA form should do, only the membership type is truly important. Adding a second cardholder is optional, so
although the ability to select adding an additional person is there, it is not required. Basic membership is the default
value in the list, which I think is reasonable according to the guidelines, and the list is sorted alphabetically to make locating the membership option easier.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
